I've created a lisp manager for Emacs (24.0 and greater) called PLEM.

What's mean P? the P is Personal or Public (if you like it) I hope every body
like it, but maybe not. any fork is welcome!

you can download the source from
[here](http://github.com/eggcaker/pelm/tarball/master) and check out [more
information](http://caker.me/pelm) Send questions, comments, complaints, and
bug reports to us.
