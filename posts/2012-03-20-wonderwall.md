### 英文歌词

Today is gonna be the day

That they're gonna throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow

Realized what you gotta do

I don't believe that anybody

Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word was on the street

That the fire in your heart is out

I'm sure you've heard it all before

But you never really had a doubt

I don't believe that anybody feels

The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk along are winding And all the lights that
lead us there are blinding

There are many things that I would Like to say to you

I don't know how

Because maybe

You're gonna be the one who saves me?

And after all

You're my wonderwall

I said maybe

You're gonna be the one who saves me?

And after all

You're my wonderwall

Said maybe

You're gonna be the one that saves me

You're gonna be the one that saves me

You're gonna be the one that saves me

### 中文歌词

今天将要会是那

他们返与你之日

现在你或多或少

意识到如何去做

我不会相信任何人

解释我现在对你的感觉

语言速散在街上

你心中火焰向外喷发

我确信你都听过

但你从不起任何疑心

我不会相信任何人

解释我现在对你的感觉

所有我们必须独自行走的道路上狂风呼啸

所有光亮引导我们去的方向竟是如此盲目

有许多许多事情我想要和你倾诉

却不知何处开口

因为，也许

你会是拯救我於痛苦的人

而且，毕竟

你就是我内心深处的迷墙

我说，也许

你会是拯救我於痛苦的人

而且，毕竟

你就是我内心深处的迷墙

说也许

你将会拯救我

你将会拯救我

你将会拯救我

乐队吉他手和主要词曲作者Noel说这首歌写的是关于在Oasis巡回演唱会中他在现场遇到的一个女孩儿。而我们听到的最多的是这首歌是写给他的前女友的（97年结婚
，四年后离婚）。对此Noel称这首歌和她没有一丝关系，他说这首歌只是写一个幻想中的能将你自己从自己解救出来的朋友而已。
好了，言归正传，歌名是Wonderwall表示迷墙，英语中很多短语都和wall 墙有关。今天我们就来看一看墙里墙外的世界。

    
    
        wallflower 壁花，在舞会中没有舞伴而坐着看的人
        Step forward to dance, Mary, do not be such a wallflower.
        走出来跳舞，玛莉，不要当壁花。
        
        stonewall 故意妨碍，阻挠
        I tried to find out who should be held responsible for the accident, but he stonewalled me.

        drive someone up the wall 使发疯，使发狂；使精神紧张；使人十分恼火
        All my problems will drive me up the wall someday.
