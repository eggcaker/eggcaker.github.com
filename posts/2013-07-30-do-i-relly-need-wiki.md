Last time I wrote blog was 2 month ago, some time i think maybe I should setup a wiki engine for me to wirte stuff. just because i think the wiki more geekly than blog, andalso guess, maybe i'll write more if use wiki. LOL!

Tody I downloaded and tested few wiki engines, like [dokuwiki](http://dokuwiki.org) ,[golum](http://github.com/gollum/gollum) and [moinmo](http://moinmo.in), after  that, i think still keep current engine - static site generator. the reasons are: 

- git versioning 
- backups 
- din't like login & write
- hosting 

especially last reason, with the static site generator, can hosting generated files anywhere with just html supported. 

after publish this post, i think i'll go back to jekyll, because it's the built in supported with github pages. HOPE this is the FINAL changes.
