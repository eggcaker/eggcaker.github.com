[GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) - Getting Things Done,
is an organizational method created by productivity consultant [David
Allen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)).

### Why Emacs & Org-Mode

the ONLY reason I use Emacs and Org-mode is : I like it ! they rock, powerful
and flexible.

file, and I can refiling to deferent files.
