This my first blog after I changed to hakyll, I spent lot of time on test different blog engine,
and lot of static site generator. the problem is I have ever really write blogs. this time, should 
be last time change the blog sytem, really? hope so!

Ok, now let me show you what's we have on this website, basiclly i use this website to do things below:

- Write blogs of course 
- Write puzzles code
- Write GTD reviews 
- host my resume 

Also have a page for my opensource projects, maybe say project right now. 
I'm sure I'll write more open source projects. add-oil!!!
